# MySQL Essentials

## 📘 Creating Tables in MySQL

### 🧑‍🎓 Second Lesson

---

## 🧠 Overview
In this lesson, I deepened my understanding of how to create and manage tables in MySQL.  
I practiced working with data types, constraints, and advanced column features like virtual and generated columns.

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

### ✅ Creating a Basic Table
- 📝 Created an `employees` table with `first_name` and `last_name` columns using the `VARCHAR` type.
- 📏 Learned that the maximum size for a `VARCHAR` column is **65,535 bytes** (limited by row size).

### ✅ Adding Constraints
- ➕ Added an `id` column with:
  - 🔢 `INT` type  
  - 🚫 `NOT NULL` constraint  
  - 🔐 `PRIMARY KEY` constraint  
  - 🔄 `AUTO_INCREMENT` behavior to automatically generate unique IDs

### ✅ Generated Columns
- 🧮 Created a `full_name` column using:
  ```sql
  full_name VARCHAR(61) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) VIRTUAL
  ```

Learned the difference between VIRTUAL and STORED generated columns.

### ✅ Adding a Birth Date Field

- 📅 Added a birth_date column with the DATE data type.
- 🔍 Learned that MySQL can infer the century if only two digits are used for the year.
