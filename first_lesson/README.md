### Introduction to MySQL
#### First lesson

### What is MySQL?
* MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage structured data. 
* It’s commonly used in web applications and supports the SQL language for querying and manipulating data.

### How to Use MySQL:
* You can run MySQL on Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
* It’s also available through cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
*  Tools like Docker can help run MySQL in containers quickly and easily.

### Database Tools:
There are both graphical and command-line tools for working with MySQL.  
Popular tools include:
* MySQL CLI (command line).
* MySQL Workbench, Adminer, PHPMyAdmin, and Sqlectron (GUI tools).

#### Using Docker Compose for MySQL, PHPMyAdmin and Adminer
I created a Docker Compose file to run MySQL together with Adminer and PHPMyAdmin, 
which makes managing the database easier and more visual. 
This setup helps me practice and understand how containers and database tools work 
together.

These tools help create databases, run queries, and visualize data.

### Understanding Relational Databases:
* Data is organized into tables (like spreadsheets). 
* Tables can be connected through relationships:
  - One-to-many: one country can have many users. 
  - One-to-one or many-to-many relationships also exist.  
* A schema defines how data is structured — including tables, columns, and relationships.

### Types of Database Engines:
* Relational (SQL) – structured data with relationships (e.g., MySQL). 
* NoSQL – flexible schema for unstructured data.
* Graph – focuses on connections between data. 
* Document-based – stores data in formats like JSON.
